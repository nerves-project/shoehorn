## v0.3.1

For Shoehorn, these are our goals:
1: Fix current issue with prod devices turning to zombies
2: Make it really really difficult to enter a brick state ever.

It was becoming apparent that it is difficult to address goal #1 by changing the defaults without impacting goal #2 at all. We believe that its best to solve goal #1  by opting in and not by modifying the defaults.

In this release, existing projects that do not declare a handler in the
config will use `Shoehorn.Handler.Ignore`.

## v0.3.0

The default strategy for how Shoehorn handles OTP application exits has changed.
Before this release, if an application were to exit the node would remain running
and that applications would remain stopped. This may be desireable for development
and test but is typically undesireable in production. This behaviour can be
customized by configuring the `handler` in the config. For example, in dev you can
use the module `Shoehorn.Handler.Ignore` to prevent the node from halting on failure.

  ```elixir
  # config/dev.exs

  config :shoehorn,
    handler: Shoehorn.Handler.Ignore
  ```
